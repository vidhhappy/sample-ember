            <p> We are interested in developing integrated clinical, experimental, and computational approaches to solve important
              challenges in medical genomics, especially cancer treatment. The advent of affordable high-throughput sequencing
              and molecular technologies are now allowing us to study cancer genomics and biology directly in large cohorts
              of patient tumors. As a former member of the Sander group at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, we have
              experience from participation in several tumor characterization projects in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
              Here we have contributed data analysis and tools for management and analysis of the massive cancer genomics
              datasets (see CGDSR, Cerami 2012, Gao 2013). Additionally, we have collaborated with multiple clinical cancer
              research groups on integrative analysis to address relevant clinical questions (Hakimi 2013, Li 2013, Barlin
              2015, Hakimi 2015). We plan to engage in new cancer genomics collaborations with excellent experimental and
              clinical groups at GIS and in Singapore.</p>

            <p> Cancer primarily develops because of somatic alterations in the genome. However, the non-protein-coding genome,
              comprising more than 98% of the human genome, remains mostly uncharted in cancer genomics. We have previously
              analyzed complete genome sequences of 863 human tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other sources to systematically
              identify noncoding regions that are frequently mutated in cancer (Weinhold & Jacobsen, et al. (2014)). We are
              further developing and applying new frequency- and sequence-based approaches to comprehensively scan cancer
              genome for noncoding mutations with potential regulatory impact (e.g. Hu et al. 2017 and Guo et al. 2018).</p>

            <h2>Discovery of miRNA-target interactions in cancer</h2>

            <p> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and protein levels by binding to mRNAs.
              Numerous studies have linked aberrant miRNA expression with regulation of diverse cancer processes. However,
              we are still far from a complete understanding of the role of individual miRNAs in patient tumors. Together
              with experimental labs, we have previously analyzed the biology and function of miRNAs in cancer cell lines
              (see e.g. Frankel 2007, Gregersen 2010, Kheir 2011, Ugras 2011, Gregersen 2012, Crone 2012). More recently,
              we have used tumor expression data and integrative cancer genomics to infer targets of miRNAs directly in patient
              tumors (see Silber 2012, Creighton 2012, Jacobsen 2013). For example, using molecular profiles of >3,000 tumors
              from 11 human cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we systematically analyzed expression of miRNAs and
              mRNAs across cancer types to infer cancer-associated miRNA-target relationships (Jacobsen 2013). We plan to
              refine this approach and apply it to new cancer types. Similarly, we are intersted in studying the function
              and cancer relevance of other classes of non-coding RNAs.</p>

        <h2> Computational Cancer Genomics</h2>
        <p> We are a computational biology group at Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS). We are particularly interested in developing
          and applying relevant computational and statistical approaches to solve emerging problems in cancer research. To
          accomplish this we work closely with excellent clinical research groups in Singapore and abroad.
        </p>
        <h2>Non-coding Cancer Genome</h2>
        <p>Non-protein-coding regulatory elements and transcripts take up a large fraction of the human genome, but their function
          and disease relevance are not well understood. We use computational approaches to identify and characterize cancer-causing
          non-coding elements from large cohorts of tumor genomes and molecular profiles.
        </p>
        <h2>Tumor Systems Biology</h2>
        <p>Signaling between cancer and non-malignant cells of the tumor microenvironment is critical in many aspects of tumor
          progression. However, there is a lack of approaches to study this phenomenon at scale in tumors. We are developing
          integrated experimental and computational techniques to study tumors at a systems level.
